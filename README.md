# IPNLISTechnicalInterview
This is a small algorithm that I was asked to write for my technical interview at the Informatics and Systems laboratory (Pedro Nunes Institute, Coimbra).
It consists of a binary-tree based algorithm that serves as a way to calculate the total stock value of a family of products sold at a hypothetical hardware shop.
Originally I wrote this in Python, however, later on I decided I would rewrite it in C just for the heck of it! Obviously, this means I'd now have to consider a few extra aspects. Such as: linked lists, proper dynamic memory management and a more difficult synthax!
